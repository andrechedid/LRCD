This a university project I worked on for a database systems course alongside 2 other colleagues using java, javaFX and MYSQL. it is a database management system for a Red Cross department where we have volunteers and chiefs and equipment's and ambulances and so on.
In order to get this running you need to add the mysql connector jar and all the required javafx jar file and javafx phoenix jar file for it to work properly the database provided should work fine with it.
